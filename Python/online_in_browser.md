# Introduction

Installing PyCharm (or any software) can be a little difficult for a newbie. Fortunately, there are many online resources to get familiar with the syntax and the features of Python before proceeding to install an IDE in the local machine.

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) (“Colab”, for short) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) are some of the most popular online platforms that allow you to write and execute Python in your browser.

# Google Colaboratory 

To get started with Colab there are two methods: 

1. **Direct link**: by accessing https://colab.research.google.com. This will open a page as shown below, and you are all set to start.

If you are not logged in with a gmail account:

If you are already logged in with a gmail account:

There are some tab options:

**EXAMPLES**: Contains several files designed to present different types of notebooks.

**RECENT**: Contains the last notebooks you have worked with.

**GOOGLE DRIVE**: Contains the notebooks you have in your Google Drive account.

**GITHUB**: Use this tab if you need to add notebooks from your GitHub, but you first need to connect Colab with GitHub!

**UPLOAD**: Upload notebooks from your local computer.

You can create a new notebook by clicking **NEW NOTEBOOK** at the bottom right corner. Or **CANCEL** if you do not wish to continue.

2. **Google Drive**: if you have a Google Drive account, access your drive https://drive.google.com as usual and look for the " + New " button which should be in the upper left corner as shown below:

Click on **+ New** :arrow_right: **More** :arrow_right: **Google Colaboratory** and you are all set to start!

:pushpin: Make sure you SignIn for a better experience. 

:pushpin: Works the best in Google Chrome! 

## New Notebook

**New Notebook** option it will create an _Untitled0.ipynb_ file and it will automatically be saved to your Google Drive in a folder named Colab Notebooks. The new file will look similarly with the following screenshot:

## Features

I will describe each feature marked in the above screenshot. 

:one: The name of the file. The extension ".ipynb" is specifically for Python.

:two: **Code** and **Text** in both places it will create a new cell either for writing code or for adding markdown plain text cell.

:three: Represents an Input code cell. Notice it begins with ":arrow_forward:". You can click on that icon to run the code in the cell or you can use the shortcut CTRL+Enter/Command+Enter.

:four: Represents an Output of the code cell. Notice it begins with a special icon. You can click on that icon to clear the output of the code cell.

:five: Other Cell - related features are:

You can: _Move Up or Move Down the Cell, Link to Cell, Add comments for a Cell, Delete the Cell_, but you can also Copy Cell (CTRL+C/Command+C), Cut Cell (CTRL+X/Command+X), Paste Cell (CTRL+V/Command+V) & Edit Cell (double click on it).

If you click on the settings button you can see the following control panel:

**Site.** Has options for the whole website with regard to the Theme (_Light, Dark, Adaptive_).

**Editor.** Has options for the editor with regard to the Text Coloring (_Default, Monokai, Intense and Synthwave84_), Key Bindings (_Default, VIM & Classic_), Font size, etc.

**Colab Pro.** They present the benefits of getting a subscrption for a Pro account. With Colab Pro you have priority access to our fastest GPUs. 

**Miscellaneous.** Power level is an April fools joke feature that adds sparks and combos to cell editing. See [their post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoogleColab/status/1112708634905964545).
