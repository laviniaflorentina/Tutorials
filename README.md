# About this ... :dizzy: 

# :construction: ... Work in Progress ... :construction:

There are many tutorials, courses and papers already published regarding these topics ... _Why another one?!_ Because this one is meant to summarize all the others! 

When I first started to learn about all this it felt to be overwhelming to follow up with the new technology tools. 

Even though there are lots of other online materials for free, especially as a beginner, it's difficult to find all you need to know in one place so you end up with even more questions and several tabs opened in your browser.. :bookmark_tabs: :hear_no_evil:

If you would like a smooth transition in deep learning concepts, you need to follow the materials in a sequential order.

Enjoy! :smile:
