# Abstract 


There are many tutorials, courses or papers on the internet on this topic. Why another one? Because this one is meant to summarize all the others. 

Many of the most advanced tools require a great deal of sophisticated knowledge in advanced mathematics and statistics as well as software engineering. 

For a beginner it might seem overwhelming, especially if you just want to apply some of the exciting models 
that creates false images or videos of celebrities or drive self-driving cars.







**NOTE.** This tutorial is only for educational purpose. It is not an academic paper. All references are listed at the end of the file.
