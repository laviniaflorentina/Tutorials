# Abstract :thought_balloon:

There are many tutorials, courses or papers already published regarding this topic, so ... _Why another one?!_ Because this one is meant to summarize all the others! :tada:

It might be overwhelming to follow up with this field, especially for a beginner. Even though there are lots of articles and other online materials for free, you can't find all you need to know in one place so you end up with even more questions and several tabs opened in your browser.

This repository aims to expose all the terminology used in Neural Networks, as well as to present and explain the most common used algorithms that you need to know in order to understand how to build your own model.

If you want to apply some of the exciting models that creates false images or videos of celebrities or drive self-driving cars, or if you just wonder about what Artificial Inteligence is about, you might find this repository useful.

**NOTE.** This tutorial is only for educational purpose. It is not an academic paper. All references are listed at the end of the file.
