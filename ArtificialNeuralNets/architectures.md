## Introduction

The neural network architecture represents the way in which the elements of the network are binned together. The architecture will define the behavior of the network. Considering their architecture, Artificial Neural Networks can be classified as follows:

# 1.	Feedforward Neural Networks (FF)

Feedforward Neural Networks were the first type of Artificial Neural Network. These kinds of nets have a large variance but there are mainly two pioneers:

## 1.1.	Singe-layer Perceptron (Perceptron)

The perceptron is the simplest type of feedforward neural network, compost of only one neuron, where:  

â€¢	It takes some inputs
